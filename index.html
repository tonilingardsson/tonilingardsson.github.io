                    <h2>House music</h2>
                    <p align=justify><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music"><strong>House music</strong></a> is a genre of electronic
                        dance music created by club DJs and music producers that originated in Chicago in the early 1980s.
                        Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms
                        mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house
                        displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalistic,
                        and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. House music initially
                        became popular in Chicago clubs in 1984, pioneered by figures such as Larry Levan, Frankie Knuckles,
                        Phuture, and Mr. Fingers, and was associated with African-American and gay subcultures. House music
                        quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, New York City, Baltimore, and Newark, all
                        of which developed their own regional scenes. In the mid-to-late 1980s, house music became popular
                        in Europe as well as major cities in South America, and Australia.</p>
                    <p align=justify>Early house music commercial success in Europe saw songs such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cak1xly8oUM">"Pump Up The Volume"</a>                        by MARRS (1987), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKxX-yWEpv8">House Nation"</a> by House
                        Master Boyz and the Rude Boy of House (1987), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSb9w9AMIOs">"Theme from S'Express"</a>                        by S'Express (1988) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWVhcVzti7A">"Doctorin' the House"</a>                        by Coldcut (1988) in the pop charts. Since the early to mid-1990s, house music has been infused in
                        mainstream pop and dance music worldwide. In the late 1980s, many local Chicago house music artists
                        suddenly found themselves presented with major label deals. House music proved to be a commercially
                        successful genre and a more mainstream pop-based variation grew increasingly popular. House music
                        in the 2010s, while keeping several of these core elements, notably the prominent kick drum on every
                        beat, varies widely in style and influence, ranging from the soulful and atmospheric deep house to
                        the more minimalistic microhouse. House music has also fused with several other genres creating fusion
                        subgenres, such as progressive house, tech house, electro house and latin house.</p>

                    <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                    <p align=justify>The song structure of house music typically involves an intro, a chorus, various verse sections, a midsection
                        and an outro. Some songs don't have a verse, taking out a part from the chorus and repeat the same
                        cycle. The drum beat is one of the more important elements within the genre and is almost always
                        provided by a drum machine. The drum beats of house are four on the floor and feature off-beat hi-hats.
                        House music is often based on bass heavy loops produced by a synthesizer and/or from samples. The
                        tempo of most house songs often lie between 118 and 135 bpm..</p>

                    <h3>Influences and precursors</h3>
                    <p align=justify>Various disco songs incorporated sounds produced with synthesizers and drum machines, and some compositions
                        were entirely electronic; examples include Giorgio Moroder's late 1970s productions such as Donna
                        Summer's hit single "I Feel Love" from 1977, Cerrone's "Supernatu (1977), Yellow Magic Orchestra's
                        synth-disco-pop productions from Yellow Magic Orchestra (1978), Solid State Survivor (1979), and
                        several early 1980s disco-pop productions by the Hi-NRG group Lime. Soul and disco influenced house
                        music, plus mixing and editing techniques earlier explored by disco, garage music and post-disco
                        DJs, producers, and audio engineers such as Walter Gibbons, Tom Moulton, Jim Burgess, Larry Levan,
                        Ron Hardy, M & M, and others who produced longer, more repetitive, and percussive arrangements of
                        existing disco recordings. Early house producers such as Frankie Knuckles created similar compositions
                        from scratch, using samplers, synthesizers, sequencers, and drum machines. The electronic instrumentation
                        and minimal arrangement of Charanjit Singh's Synthesizing: Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat (1982), an album
                        of Indian ragas performed in a disco style, anticipated the sounds of acid house music, but it is
                        not known to have had any influence on the genre prior to the album's rediscovery in the 21st century.</p>
